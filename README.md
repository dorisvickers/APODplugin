Welcome to the exciting world of astronomical image analysis using the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) archive.

I created this plugin as a capstone project of a university course. It automatically classifies the last 30 pictures of the APOD using Keyword Analysis and then find similiar other APODs. It also lets users chat about the images.

1) Activate the plugin in WordPress

2) Configure API keys in Settings > APOD AI

3) Add shortcode [apod_ai_analysis] to any page
